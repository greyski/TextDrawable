# Android TextDrawable

Simple, and light-weight drawable capable of displaying all text types (including emoji) by utilizing the 
StaticLayout base rendering class found inside of TextView. This drawable is used for displaying ineditable text
as well as flattening View heirarchies where TextViews cause unnecessary bloat. Through the intelligent use of regular
drawables and TextDrawables, most (if not all) layout structures can be built/designed using a single View element.
